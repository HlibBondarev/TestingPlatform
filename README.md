# TestingPlatform
TestingPlatform is an application for testing students
Using TestingPlatform, you can create tests where students will choose the right answers from the proposed ones or enter their own options. TestingPlatform is very easy to use - you can understand the interface in just a couple of minutes. The Trainer has the ability to create not only text questions, but also questions containing pictures, video or audio files (in the initial version of the application, you can use files with the extension - ".gif", ".png", ".jpg" and up to 1 MB in size).

The site can host both paid and free tests. An unauthorized user can only pass free tests, but his test results are not saved. Tests are divided according to the following hierarchy: Subject - Specialty - Course - Subject. The application provides testing throughout the course or on a particular topic of the course (for an intermediate test of students' knowledge and preparing them for testing at the whole course). If the course offered by the Trainer doesn't apply to any subject and specialty already on the site, the Trainer can offer his own subject and specialty. After approval by the site administration, they will be added to the list of topics.

The application uses three roles for authorized users: User, Moderator and Amin.

1. Admin manage the site, including: creates new subjects and specialties, or approves the proposed ones; confirms Moderator subscription; has the ability to edit existing and add new courses.

2. Moderator has the following features: to offer new subjects and specialties for testing; add new courses (in the amount corresponding to the issued subscription); subscribe new subscribers to his own courses and control their test results; assign other Moderators to his own courses, that will give them the opportunity to participate in the creation and improvement of courses, as well as give access to the subscribers test results to this course.

3. User can use the following options offered by the site: pass free tests; subscribe to any tests for the course he likes (for subscribed users, all results of the passed tests will be saved and available to them); request the status of a Moderator; receive an assignment from the course creator, that will make it possible to participate in its moderation.
